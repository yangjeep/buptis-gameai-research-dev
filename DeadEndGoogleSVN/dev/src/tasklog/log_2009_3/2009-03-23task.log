--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.Build Three Different Cat Strategies
    Explain the three strategies on the group
2.Build Three Types of Monte Carlo Method
    (1)Monte Carlo based on Direcitons with no supervision
        deadend.ai.dog.monteCarlo
    (2)Monte Carlo based on Directions with supervision
        deadend.ai.dog.monteCarloAdv
    (3)Monte Carlo based on State
        deadend.ai.dog.monteCarloState
3.Plot the Time of Monte Carlo Method - Wining Rate correlation
4.Build ANN advance with 28 inputs
    file path: db/annAdv
    record the data for every group for 200 games
    train the ann in WEKA
    Copy the data back to ANN
    Record the wining rate
5.Cross-Group Experiment
    Proof that only the corresponding ANN fighting against the Cat will get best
    Cat Strategy 1 - ANN-1, ANN-2, ANN-3
    Cat Strategy 2 - ANN-1, ANN-2, ANN-3
    Cat Strategy 3 - ANN-1, ANN-2, ANN-3
6.Build a Dynamic Tree Search for UCT/Monte Carlo Method
    Try to see the improvement of the dynamic depth adjustment of Tree Search
    Resources: Google group
7.Measure the Improvement of Time on the calculation
    Using Monte Carlo Method (Real-Time Calculation) vs. ANN
